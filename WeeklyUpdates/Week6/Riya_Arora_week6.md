3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** 

     This week we took the time to review the feedback we got from feedback fruits from our peers and edit our proposal that was due for final submission. We also had a meeting to discuss the component form that was due on Monday Feb 19 as there were two parts that we needed to order. The only issue we had was submitting the doc, we had an issue with exporting it from OneDrive but I was able to force it out via Pages on Mac so the professor was very understanding and allowed us to submit a day late.

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** 

     The progress is going well, we were able to gain some good feedback from the feedback fruit activity which was really helpful for us in terms of wrapping up our final propsal.

     Next week is Week 7 and is reading week! We will take a short break and resume our progress in Week 8.  

6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?***
