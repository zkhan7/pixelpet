     This week, we took the time to do a vote on which of the 4 topics that all 4 of the group members came up with, unfortunately all of us voted        once for each topic ! So it was a 4 way tie. We all met up during the lab period last friday Jan 26 to discuss how we can go about the issue.        While in the lab, we ended up brainstorming and coming up with an idea for a simulated pet project. We are all very excited to do this idea and      it is feasible for the deadline. We talked to our TA Oly who checked if the new idea met all the requirements for the project which is did. We       then starting drafting our pre proposal for the peer review activity in week 4!
