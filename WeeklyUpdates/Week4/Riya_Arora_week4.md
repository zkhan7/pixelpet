4. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** 

     This week we did in class to review others pre-proposals but also get valuable feedback for ours. This was very helpful as we all discussed the feedback as a group after and got some good suggestions that we are going to implement as we carry on. After that we started to divide tasks for the draft proposal due next week at the beginning of Week 5 and creted the document. Worked on the proposal for about 5 hours in total and have a pretty solid proposal that we can gain some feedback on next week in class. Decided to get it done earlier this week as our team has other midterms and tests coming back so we wanted to get a head start.

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** 

     The progress is going well, we were able to gain some good feedback and divided the tasks accordingly to ensure we are all working on the proposal and getting it done for next week. 

5. ***What are you planning to do next week***?

     Since next week is Week 5, we will review eachothers rough draft proposals in class and during week 5 we will review the feedback we get and make any changes before we are ready to submit it for the final deadline on Fed 14th (beginning of week 6)

6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?***
   
     Nope
